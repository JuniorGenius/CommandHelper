<ins>Underline</ins> = not possible/partially done

<del>Strikethrough</del> = done

1. Ships to be made, like a structure that is on water in some way, which will be controlled by signs, which one would be named [engine] when written, but then turned into "This way!" after pressing done. Then when right clicking on that sign, it'll move the opposite direction of the sign by one block. Of course, ships can be made out of anything except for sand, gravel, stone, grass, mycelium or dirt. It also has another sign that can be used called [elevator] when typed in, when done, it shall then say "Vertical Movement" and if left clicked, then it shall go up by one block. If right clicked, it shall go down by one block. A ship can be any amount of blocks, and will say "Obstacles on the course" if the structure runs into sand/gravel/dirt etc. There is another sign that says on the first line [ships] then either ship, plane, submarine or rocket. Rockets shall flip vertically when at 100Y. Submarines can use [elevator] only if touching water, in any way. Planes can use [elevator] and practically anything, and can fly anywhere. Ships are well, the smaller end of the stick without the power to use [elevator]. 

2. Factions, but redone. It'd practically mimic the plugin, factions, but with a few small differences. First of all, power shall be added by one, if 10 mobs are slain, winning the PVP arena, using a socket gem, or winning the mob arena. It also has a new command, /f spawnmob {Mob}. The mobs that can be spawned are: horse, zombie, and spider. Right clicking them opens a chest GUI with an identical amount as the player. They have AI like a zombie and a witch combined. If potions are given, they shall be used up when a player from a different faction is spotted. If it is given armor, then it shall put on the first armor given, but if new armor is given, it'll take it off, and put the new armor on. If it is given blocks, it shall not use it, but instead store it. A mob takes 10 power to summon, by the way. After all this, a faction mob can have orders too, when right clicked and then exiting the GUI. This can be used (after right clicking) with /f order {order}. The orders are: Tphere, which makes the mob teleport to you, Explore, which makes the mob roam around a lot, Follow, which makes the mob RIGHT behind you, and search, which scouts out an entity at most 50 blocks away, and slays it. Also for these mobs, faction leaders can use /f color, using RRBBGG scale, which shall color leather armor if it is not dyed already, along with any wool in the mob's inventory. This is for all around every faction mob. 

3. PVP arena. Making a new arena is like mob arena, do /pa p1, then /pa p2. Then you can use /pa regionshow which makes a wool outline of the arena for a few seconds, then disappears. Beforehand, /pa create {Name} should be done, then /pa edit {Name}. Afterwards, /pa goal {goal} should be specified. This can be specified to either Capture the flag, or Death Match. If death match, then /pa TDM {team life number} should be used. If capture the flag, then /pa CTF {team} should be done, after using that, click on a block, and then the team listed gets that block. /pa team new {team name} should be used to make a new team. Of course, classes with leather armor that is not dyed shall be a color specific to the team. To choose, use /pa team color {team} {color by number &}. To make the warp where the player chooses a class, that shall be set by /pa setlobby. To make a class, do /pa class save {name}. To list the classes, do /pa class list. to choose a class, make a sign, then have it named the class, but nothing more. It shall be then right clicked, and the player's inventory shall be the exact class saved before. Then, to make a team's spawnpoint, say /pa set spawn {team name}. The arena's blocks can be destroyed and added, but after the match is over, the arena shall look exactly like how it was before the players have joined the match. To have a player be ready for the battle, they say /pa ready. When done making an arena for the time, say /pa done. All mobs spawned shall be instantly tamed.

4. Mob arena. It shall be almost the same as PVP arena, except random mobs appear. For capture the flag, mobs shall for the most part, try to touch the defending block, but some mobs stay behind to defend their block. 

5. Other Mobs. A kraken for the seas (A squid) and a wyvern for the skies (ender dragon). Krakens basically use fireballs, and lash out at players. They only spawn in the ocean, but can be artificially spawned by using /k spawnegg {name}. If a direct approach is in order, use /kraken {name}. This is just like the wyvern, but the wyvern only spawns in 150+ Y and does not try to go lower than 100Y. 

6. <ins>World Guard. Is it possible to replicate it?</ins> (We will use WorldGuard.)

7. Hangman. It shall be used by /hangman new {word} and /hangman guess {letter/cluster of letters.}. 

8. Shop. It shall be used by signs, and these signs shall be right clicked to buy, and left clicked to sell. The first line says: Shop. The second line says the amount of how much is being sold/bought. The third line is for how much it is bought for/sold for by B {number}:{number} S. The fourth line is the item. Items can also have lores/enchants and such, by saying /shop new {name}. Whatever is in your hand shall be put in. /shop delete {name} to delete it.

9. Bank. Use /bank deposit to deposit an item, and /bank withdraw to withdraw an item. Loans can also be made, every minecraft day adds one more amount of an item needed to be paid back. After 20 minecraft days, an admin shall receive a PM of which players has not fully paid back their loan. To loan, say /loan {item} {amount}.

10. <del>Renaming/Reloring. To easily rename an item, say /rename {name} and to relore, do /relore {line number} {text} Enchantments shall be placed like this too, but also there'd be a list of exact enchantment names (please!)</del>

11. Market. use /market listings to see everything up for sale. To make something up for sale, type /market create {amount} {price}. To buy an item, double click on the item, and it shall be in your inventory. The seller shall receive their money.

12. Plotme. Can you replicate plotme?

13. <del>Custom Heads. Heads can be spawned by /head {player name, or mob name}. There is also a 12% chance a head of a mob can be spawned.</del>

14. Locks. Place a sign on a container to make it only used for the certain player. Right click it and then say /lock add {name} to add another person's use to your chest.

15. Disguises. use /d to disguise as a mob, or a player! /u to undo it

16. Usage wand. use a blaze rod for this, right click to shuffle through spells, left click to use a spell. The spells are: Lightning (Makes lightning appear at the location pointed to) explosion wave (makes a wave of lit tnt!) confuse (makes the pointed to entity get nausea) rift (sends the pointed to entity warp to the end.) grab (makes an entity come closer to you) push (makes an entity go farther from you).
